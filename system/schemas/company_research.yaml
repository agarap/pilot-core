# Company Research Schema
# Standalone schema for company/startup research work items in the pilot system.
#
# Company research items represent structured intelligence gathering about
# companies and startups. This schema supports multi-dimensional research
# with question-driven investigation and confidence-weighted findings.
#
# Usage:
#   - Create company research items in work_list.json with type: "company_research"
#   - Use @company-researcher for deep, multi-factorial intelligence
#   - Use @web-researcher for specific research threads
#   - Track findings with confidence and source citations
#   - Output comprehensive research to projects/<company>/research/
#
# See also: system/schemas/work_item.yaml for the unified work item schema

              Strong in real-time data streaming and ETL. Their core product
              handles high-volume data pipelines (1M+ events/sec claimed).
              Good connector ecosystem (150+ integrations). API-first design
              aligns well with our architecture.

              12 of their public case studies are in our target segments.

          - question: "Are there any red flags or concerns?"
            answer: |
              One concern: They had layoffs in 2023 (reduced 20% of staff).
              However, this appears to be market correction rather than
              fundamental issues - they've resumed hiring in 2024.
              Glassdoor ratings dropped post-layoff but recovering.

              - "LinkedIn headcount data"
              - "Glassdoor reviews (3.8/5)"
          - question: "Would this partnership be strategically valuable?"
            answer: |
              Recommendation: PROCEED with partnership.
              Strategic value is high due to:
              1. Complementary capabilities (they do data pipes, we do analytics)
              2. Strong customer overlap in target verticals
              3. Technical alignment (API-first, modern stack)
              4. Their sales team is strong in regions we're weak

              Suggested terms: Start with co-marketing and technical integration.
              Evaluate co-sell after 6 months of technical partnership.
