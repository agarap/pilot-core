  - agent: builder

rule: |
  Create git commits frequently as recovery checkpoints.

  Commit after:
  - Creating a new file
  - Completing a logical unit of work
  - Before making risky changes
  - After successful tests

  Commit message format:
  - Start with verb: Add, Fix, Update, Remove, Refactor
  - Be specific: "Add weather tool with httpx" not "Add tool"
  - Keep under 50 characters

  Before risky operations:
  1. Commit current state
  2. Note the commit hash
  3. Proceed with risky change
  4. If it fails, can recover with: git checkout <hash>

  The recover.sh script can also help restore from commits.
