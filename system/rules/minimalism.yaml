  Always prefer the simplest solution that solves the problem.

  Principles:
  - One file is better than two
  - Built-in is better than dependency
  - Explicit is better than clever
  - Working is better than elegant

  Before adding complexity, ask:
  - Do we need this now, or is it speculative?
  - Can we solve this with existing tools?
  - What's the simplest thing that could work?

  Code minimalism:
  - No unused imports
  - No commented-out code
  - No "just in case" parameters
  - No premature abstractions

  Dependency minimalism:
  - Check if stdlib can do it first
  - One library per purpose
  - Prefer well-maintained, focused packages

  When in doubt, leave it out. It's easier to add later than remove.
