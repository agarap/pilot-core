description: Clear decision criteria for routing research projects to correct namespaces
priority: 95
when:
  - agent: pilot
  - agent: builder
  - agent: web-researcher
  - agent: academic-researcher

rule: |
  ## Core Principle: work/ = ONLY Parallel.ai

  Everything else goes to personal/, including ALL family members' professional work.

  ## Research Project Routing Decision Tree

  ```
  Research Request
       │
       ▼
  Is this for Parallel.ai?
       │
       ├─ YES → work/parallel/ or work/research/
       │
       └─ NO → Is this health-related?
               │
               ├─ YES → WHOSE health?
               │         │
               │         ├─ Mine → personal/my-health/{category}/
               │         ├─ Wife → personal/wife-health/{category}/
               │         ├─ Children → personal/children-health/{category}/
               │         ├─ Parents → personal/parents-health/{category}/
               │         └─ Professional for family → personal/friends-and-family/professional-research/
               │
               └─ NO → personal/finance/ or personal/friends-and-family/
                       - Investment research
                       - Family matters
                       - Professional work for family/friends
  ```

  ## Quick Reference Examples

  | Research Type | Goes To | Why |
  |---------------|---------|-----|
  | Dental implants for sister-in-law's practice | personal/friends-and-family/professional-research/sister-in-law-dental-practice/ | Family professional = personal |
  | PCSK9 inhibitors for wife's work | personal/friends-and-family/professional-research/wife-medical-work/ | Family work = personal |
  | Competitive analysis for wife's company | personal/friends-and-family/ | Not Parallel.ai = personal |
  | GTM strategy for Parallel | work/parallel/gtm/ | Parallel.ai work |
  | AI agent frameworks for Parallel | work/research/agent-frameworks/ | Parallel.ai research |
  | Personal cholesterol management | personal/my-health/cardiovascular-and-cholesterol/ | Personal health |
  | Investment research | personal/finance/ | Personal finance |

  ## Key Questions to Ask

  When routing is unclear, Pilot should ask:

  1. "Is this research/work specifically for Parallel.ai?"
     - YES → work/
     - NO → personal/

  2. "If health-related, whose health is this for?"
     - You → personal/my-health/
     - Wife → personal/wife-health/
     - Children → personal/children-health/
     - Parents → personal/parents-health/
     - Professional for family → personal/friends-and-family/professional-research/

  3. "What's the purpose?"
     - Parallel.ai business → work/
     - Personal health condition → personal/{person}-health/
     - Family member's professional needs → personal/friends-and-family/professional-research/
     - Personal finance → personal/finance/

  ## Privacy Implications

  - **personal/** content NEVER appears in work contexts
  - **work/** content CAN be referenced in personal contexts
  - Family members' professional work gets same privacy as health data

  ## File Naming Within Namespaces

  Once routed to correct namespace, follow naming conventions:

  **Personal health/professional research:**
  - Add context: `pcsk9-inhibitors-wifes-work-2025.md`
  - Or keep generic if sensitive: `pcsk9-research-2025.md`

  **Work/Parallel.ai research:**
  - Be specific: `parallel-gtm-competitor-analysis-2025.md`
  - Include Parallel context: `parallel-devrel-strategy-2025.md`

  ## Enforcement

  - Pilot checks this guide before creating projects
  - Git-reviewer ensures no personal content in work commits
  - When ambiguous, ALWAYS ASK rather than guess
